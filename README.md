My name is Guillermo, I am a **web development** student with a background in digital art.

I began my professional journey in 2020 during the covid pandemic, where I started working as an online **freelance illustrator**.
Soon after that, I studied **3D animation** and then I joined a postgraduate visual design art program in **U-Tad**,
where I got to work in *[Bugs N' Guns](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2648130/Bugs_N_Guns/)*.

In 2024 I joined the Ao Norte team, working as a 3D artist in the game *[Tiny Garden](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2812450/Tiny_Garden/)*.

That same year I took a **Python** summer course, where I found a passion for **programming and development** and decided to make it my career.

Currently, I'm working on my degree and finding projects to take part in.
